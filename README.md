Before a research, there is a literature review of the current state of the art.
Then, you come up with a research question.

## Research question
How can a noninvasive BCI be extended to work from a distance without requiring anything worn by a user?

# Method (TODO: choose one based on a literature review)
This is a practical problem. Hence, it is applied research. 
In applied research, we basically review literature for past solutions.
Then, we synthesize them into a new solution that brings us at least a little bit closer to the goal.
Next, we extend the new solution with our own knowledge, build it, evaluate it against the problem, publish it.

In this specific case, BCI can be achieved using different approaches.
It can be EEG, functional ultrasound, MEG, and other approaches.

After reviewing those approaches that exist (state of the art), can a new approach be synthesized that performs slightly better (measurably) from a distance than state of the art?
We could also review different implementations of one and the same approach, for example functional ultrasound, 
and make a hypothesis about what will make it perform better from a distance, then build it, evaluate it (that’s like an experimental proof), and publish it.

A completely different way to research it is when you see each approach to BCI as a different physics problem.
Then, you map each approach to its physics theoretical framework. 
You use the latest, best versions of those physics theories, and you compare them against our today’s implementations 
in engineering, and you find something you can improve in today’s implementations to achieve a better functionality from 
a distance. This requires physics (theoretical), then a suggestion of what you would improve is your hypothesis. Next, you will use experimental physics to test your suggestion in isolation, in a lab, and finally you will recommend to engineers to next time use your findings while building that type of BCI. The result will then have a better capability for working from a distance.
